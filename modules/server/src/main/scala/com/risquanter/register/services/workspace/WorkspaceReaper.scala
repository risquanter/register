/** Background daemon that periodically evicts expired workspaces.
  *
  * == Why a marker trait? ==
  * `WorkspaceReaper` is a zero-method marker trait — it exists solely so that
  * `ZLayer.make` materialises the reaper layer. ZIO's `ZLayer.make` macro only
  * constructs layers that are transitively required by the declared output type.
  * A `ZLayer[..., Nothing, Unit]` with no downstream dependents would be silently
  * skipped. By outputting a named marker type and including it in the application's
  * output type, we guarantee the daemon fiber is always started — and the layer
  * graph remains self-documenting (you can see at a glance that the application
  * includes a workspace reaper).
  *
  * == Lifecycle ==
  * Uses `ZLayer.scoped` + `forkScoped`: the reaper fiber's lifetime is tied to
  * the layer scope. On application shutdown, ZIO interrupts the fiber automatically
  * — graceful shutdown with zero manual fiber management.
  *
  * == Cascade deletion ==
  * When workspaces expire, their associated trees must be cascade-deleted to prevent
  * orphans. The reaper calls `RiskTreeService.delete` for each tree in the evicted
  * workspace, which triggers the full pipeline: repo delete → cache evict → SSE notify.
  * This mirrors `WorkspaceLifecycleController.deleteWorkspace`'s cascade pattern. Tree deletion
  * failures are ignored (best-effort) — a tree may already have been manually deleted.
  *
  * Scenario branches (`scenarios.<wsId>.*`, milestone-2b Phase B) are cascade-deleted
  * the same way via `ScenarioService.cascadeDeleteScenarios` (best-effort, same
  * single source of truth reused by `WorkspaceLifecycleController.deleteWorkspace`
  * and `evictExpired`). Without this, an expired workspace's scenario branches
  * would never be reclaimed — they'd survive in Irmin forever, unreachable by any
  * workspace key. On the in-memory backend, listing scenarios fails with
  * `ScenariosNotSupported`; that failure is swallowed the same as any other
  * best-effort cascade failure (nothing to clean up).
  *
  * == Enterprise no-op ==
  * When both `ttl` and `idleTimeout` are zero or negative, `Workspace.isExpired`
  * can never return `true`, so the reaper loop would be pure waste. The layer
  * detects this and skips the fiber entirely.
