  /** The anonymous sentinel UUID.
    *
    * Used in capability-only mode (noOp) where no identity is asserted.
    * MUST NOT be granted any permission in SpiceDB — if it is, capability-only
    * mode silently carries real authorization power into fine-grained mode
    * (ADR-012 §7 — Trust Assumption T4).
    *
    * The value is all-zeros by convention:
    *   - Recognisable in logs ("this is a sentinel, not a real user")
    *   - Easily excluded by SpiceDB provisioning CI checks
    *   - Unlikely to collide with any Keycloak-issued UUID
    *
    * Two independent mitigations are required:
    *
    * [Layer 1 — Scala type system / Wave 0B — pending implementation]:
    *   `UserId` becomes a sum type (`Anonymous | Authenticated`). `AuthorizationService.check()`
    *   accepts only `UserId.Authenticated`. Passing this sentinel to `check()` becomes a compile
    *   error, not a runtime behaviour gap. Eliminates the code-path risk entirely.
    *   See AUTHORIZATION-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md §B for the full migration scope.
    *
    * [Layer 2 — SpiceDB schema / Wave 3 — still required after Wave 0B]:
    *   A CEL caveat or schema-level subject constraint that rejects `user:00000000-...` as a
    *   valid SpiceDB subject. This independent infrastructure layer remains necessary even after
    *   Wave 0B: it guards against bypasses that skip the application layer (direct SpiceDB API
    *   calls, misconfigured service accounts, operator error). MUST be in place before
    *   `fine-grained` mode is activated in any non-development namespace.
    *
    * @see AUTHORIZATION-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md — Wave 0B (UserId sum type)
    * @see docs/ADR-012.md §7 — Trust Assumption T4
